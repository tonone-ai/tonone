# Tonone

**Your AI team, second to none.**

23 specialists. Engineering executes. Product decides. One session, two commands, zero meetings. 125 skills across every discipline. MIT licensed.

## Why This Exists

Right now, everyone gets a generalized AI assistant. Engineers, product managers, designers, strategists — all prompting separately, getting separate outputs, then copying results into Slack threads for the next person to feed back into AI. It's a relay race where every handoff loses context.

**The team is the unit. Not the assistant.** Instead of giving each person an AI assistant, give the whole company an AI team. Specialists that talk to each other, share context, and run the show end to end — from user research to infrastructure to deployment — without the copy-paste relay.

That's Tonone. Not twenty-three copies of the same generalist. Twenty-three specialists, each owning one domain, coordinated by leads who know when to call who and at what depth. Production-ready output. No tutorials. No boilerplate.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (primary)

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) v1.0+

From your terminal:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tonone-ai/tonone
claude plugin install tonone@tonone-ai
```

Or inside an active Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace add tonone-ai/tonone
/plugin install tonone@tonone-ai
```

Your team is ready:

```text
> /apex-plan Build a real-time analytics platform for our IoT fleet
> /helm-brief Define the next product sprint
> /forge-infra Set up cloud infrastructure for a new SaaS product
> /spine-api Design a REST API for user management
> /warden-audit Run a full security audit on this codebase
> /echo-interview Run a user research session
> /crest-roadmap Build a product roadmap
```

### Codex CLI

**Prerequisites:** [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonone-ai/tonone
cd tonone
codex
```

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Invoke agents and skills by describing what you want:

```text
> Read agents/forge.md and act as Forge — audit this infrastructure
> Read agents/apex.md — plan this project with S/M/L options
> Follow the workflow in skills/warden-audit/SKILL.md
```

Skills are markdown workflow documents in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Read them and follow the steps — no slash commands needed.

## What You Get

Every specialist ships in three modes:

| Mode       | What It Means                                         | Example Skills                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build**  | Create from scratch — production-ready, not tutorials | `/forge-infra`, `/spine-api`, `/prism-ui`, `/touch-app`         |
| **Review** | Audit and fix existing systems                        | `/warden-audit`, `/relay-audit`, `/prism-audit`, `/vigil-check` |
| **Recon**  | Survey a domain for system takeover                   | `/forge-recon`, `/spine-recon`, `/flux-recon`, `/apex-takeover` |

### They detect your stack

Every engineering agent adapts to what you're already using:

- **Cloud:** GCP, AWS, Azure, Cloudflare, Vercel, Fly.io, Hetzner, DigitalOcean
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Cloud Build, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java/Kotlin, Ruby
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, BigQuery, Snowflake, Supabase, Planetscale
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, Astro
- **Mobile:** Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, React Native, Flutter
- **ML:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Vertex AI, SageMaker, OpenAI, Anthropic

### The Leads

**Apex** leads the engineering team. Tell it what you're building:

```text
You: "Build user authentication for our SaaS"

Apex: I see 3 ways to approach this:

  S — Quick & focused (Spine + Warden, ~30K tokens, ~$0.05)
      Basic JWT auth with security review.

  M — Solid implementation (Spine + Warden + Flux + Relay, ~120K tokens, ~$0.20)
      Auth + session management + user schema + CI tests.

  L — Full build-out (+ Vigil + Atlas, ~250K tokens, ~$0.45)
      Everything in M + monitoring + documentation.

  My recommendation: M. Which level?
```

**Helm** is the head of product. It orchestrates research, strategy, design, and marketing — then hands off a structured brief to Apex when it's time to build.

### System Takeover

Inherited a codebase? Apex runs parallel reconnaissance across all specialists:

```text
> /apex-takeover

Phase 1 — Recon (parallel):
  Atlas maps the architecture
  Forge inventories infrastructure
  Relay assesses the pipeline
  Warden scans for security issues
  Vigil checks observability

Phase 2 — Deep dive (targeted):
  Spine reviews backend quality
  Flux assesses database health
  Prism audits frontend

Phase 3 — Takeover report:
  System map, risk assessment, quick wins, roadmap
```
