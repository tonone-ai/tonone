# Tonone

**Engineering second to none.**

Your elite engineering team as [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents. 1 lead + 12 specialists. 64 skills. Every major engineering discipline covered.

Simple by default. Scalable by design.

## Why This Exists

Right now, every engineer gets a generalized AI assistant. Everyone prompts separately, gets separate outputs, then copies results into Slack threads for the next person to feed back into AI. It's a relay race where every handoff loses context.

**That's the wrong unit of automation.** Instead of giving each person an AI assistant, give the whole department an AI team. Specialists that talk to each other, share context, and run the show end to end — infrastructure to deployment to monitoring — without the copy-paste relay.

That's Tonone. Not thirteen copies of the same generalist. Thirteen specialists, each owning one domain, coordinated by a lead who knows when to call who and at what depth.

### The Mindset

**Complexity is debt.** Every unnecessary abstraction, every over-engineered solution, every "just in case" feature — it all accrues interest. It slows you down today and buries you tomorrow.

**Scalability compounds.** When you build simple, correct foundations, they carry more weight over time without breaking. Simple systems are easier to debug, easier to extend, and easier to hand off.

No boilerplate generators. No tutorial-grade scaffolds. Production-ready output that respects your codebase, your stack, and your time.

```

## What You Get

Every agent can **build**, **review**, and **recon**:

| Mode       | What It Means                                         | Example Skills                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build**  | Create from scratch — production-ready, not tutorials | `/forge-infra`, `/spine-api`, `/prism-ui`, `/touch-app`         |
| **Review** | Audit and fix existing systems                        | `/warden-audit`, `/relay-audit`, `/prism-audit`, `/vigil-check` |
| **Recon**  | Survey a domain for system takeover                   | `/forge-recon`, `/spine-recon`, `/flux-recon`, `/apex-takeover` |

### Platform-Aware

Every agent detects your stack and adapts:

- **Cloud:** GCP, AWS, Azure, Cloudflare, Vercel, Fly.io, Hetzner, DigitalOcean
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Cloud Build, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java/Kotlin, Ruby
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, BigQuery, Snowflake, Supabase, Planetscale
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, Astro
- **Mobile:** Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, React Native, Flutter
- **ML:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Vertex AI, SageMaker, OpenAI, Anthropic

### The Lead: Apex

Apex is the engineering lead. Give it a task, it figures out who to involve and at what depth:

```
You: "Build user authentication for our SaaS"

Apex: I see 3 ways to approach this:

  S — Quick & focused (Spine + Warden, ~30K tokens, ~$0.05)
      Basic JWT auth with security review.

  M — Solid implementation (Spine + Warden + Flux + Relay, ~120K tokens, ~$0.20)
      Auth + session management + user schema + CI tests.

  L — Full build-out (+ Vigil + Atlas, ~250K tokens, ~$0.45)
      Everything in M + monitoring + documentation.

  My recommendation: M. Which level?
```

### System Takeover

Inherited a codebase? Apex runs parallel reconnaissance across all specialists:

```
> /apex-takeover

Phase 1 — Recon (parallel):
  Atlas maps the architecture
  Forge inventories infrastructure
  Relay assesses the pipeline
  Warden scans for security issues
  Vigil checks observability

Phase 2 — Deep dive (targeted):
  Spine reviews backend quality
  Flux assesses database health
  Prism audits frontend

Phase 3 — Takeover report:
  System map, risk assessment, quick wins, roadmap
```
