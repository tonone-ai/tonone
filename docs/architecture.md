# Architecture

How Tonone is structured and why.

## Overview

Tonone is a Claude Code plugin that installs 23 agents and 125 skills across two teams: Engineering (15 agents) and Product (8 agents). Everything is prompt-based — agents are Markdown system prompts, skills are Markdown workflow definitions. No runtime code is required.

## Platform Support

| Platform    | Support   | Config file | Skills                                 |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | Primary   | `CLAUDE.md` | Slash commands via plugin system       |
| Codex CLI   | Secondary | `AGENTS.md` | Read `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly |

Claude Code is the intended platform. Codex users read `AGENTS.md` for team context, then manually read agent definitions (`agents/<name>.md`) and skill workflows (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — the content is identical, only the invocation mechanism differs.

```
User runs /forge-audit
  → Claude Code loads the skill prompt from skills/forge-audit/SKILL.md
  → Claude Code loads the agent definition from agents/forge.md
  → The agent executes using Claude Code's tools (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
```

## Why Files Exist in Two Places

### Agents: `team/<agent>/agents/` and `agents/`

The `team/` directory is the **source of truth** — it's where you develop and edit. The root `agents/` directory is what Claude Code actually loads when the plugin is installed.

Why not just use one location? The plugin system needs agent definitions at the root level for discovery. But each agent's full context (skills, hooks, scripts, tests) lives together in `team/` for development ergonomics.

**Rule:** Edit in `team/<agent>/agents/`, copy to `agents/`.

### Skills: `team/<agent>/skills/` and `skills/`

Same pattern. Skills are authored in `team/<agent>/skills/` alongside their agent, then copied to the flat `skills/` directory at root.

The flat root structure exists because Claude Code's plugin system discovers skills from the install root. Nested paths under `team/` wouldn't be found.

**Rule:** Edit in `team/<agent>/skills/`, copy to `skills/`.

## Plugin System

### plugin.json

Every plugin level has a `plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "tonone",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "description": "...",
  "author": { "name": "tonone-ai", "url": "https://tonone.ai" },
  "repository": "https://github.com/tonone-ai/tonone",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["agents", "engineering-team"]
}
```

- **Root** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) — The main package. Installing `tonone` gets everything.
- **Team** (`team/<agent>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) — Individual agent packages. These exist for standalone installs but most users install the root bundle.

### marketplace.json

The marketplace registry (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) lists all installable plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "tonone-ai",
  "owner": { "name": "tonone-ai", "url": "https://tonone.ai" },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "tonone",
      "source": "./",
      "tags": ["bundle", "full-team"]
    },
    {
      "name": "forge-infra",
      "source": "./team/forge",
      "category": "infrastructure",
      "tags": ["infrastructure", "cloud"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `source` field points to the directory containing the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Install Flow

```
/plugin marketplace add tonone-ai/tonone     ← registers the marketplace
/plugin install tonone@tonone-ai              ← installs root bundle (all 23 agents)
/plugin install forge-infra@tonone-ai         ← or install one agent
```

## Agent Model

```
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │  Apex   │  model: opus
                    │ (Lead)  │  tools: + Agent
                    └────┬────┘
                         │ dispatches
        ┌────────┬───────┼───────┬────────┐
        ▼        ▼       ▼       ▼        ▼
    ┌───────┐┌───────┐┌──────┐┌───────┐┌──────┐
    │ Forge ││ Spine ││ Flux ││Warden ││ ...  │  model: sonnet
    │       ││       ││      ││       ││      │  tools: standard
    └───────┘└───────┘└──────┘└───────┘└──────┘
       14 specialists
```

- **Apex** uses `opus` and the `Agent` tool to coordinate specialists
- **Specialists** use `sonnet` and the standard tool set (Bash, Read, Glob, Grep, Write)
- Users can invoke any agent directly via skills, or go through Apex for orchestrated workflows

## Hooks

Each agent has a `hooks/hooks.json` that runs `setup.sh` on post-install:

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "event": "post_install",
      "command": "bash scripts/setup.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

The setup script creates a Python virtual environment. This exists for future use — the Python scaffolding is ready for agents that need local analysis tools, but current agents work entirely through Claude Code's built-in tools.

## Scripts (Future)

Each agent has a Python package in `team/<agent>/scripts/`:

```
scripts/
├── <agent>_agent/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── runner.py       ← scaffold (NotImplementedError)
├── pyproject.toml
└── setup.sh
```

This is scaffolding for future backing implementations. If an agent needs local computation (e.g., parsing ASTs, running static analysis, processing large datasets), the Python package is where that logic would live. Today, all agents work purely through prompts.

## Output System

All agent CLI output follows a shared design system defined in `docs/output-kit.md`. The Output Kit enforces:

- **40-line max** per skill output (fits one terminal screen)
- **Box-drawing skeleton** for structured sections
- **Unified severity indicators** (CRIT / WARN / INFO / OK)

### Atlas Output Skills

Atlas owns three skills for rendering agent work into shareable formats:

- **`/atlas-report`** — renders findings as styled HTML reports and opens them in the browser
- **`/atlas-changelog`** — three-layer changelog management: per-repo, cross-repo, and per-agent changelogs
- **`/atlas-present`** — generates release presentations as HTML pages and Obsidian Canvas files

### Changelog Automation

A `PostToolUse` hook in the Atlas agent automatically appends changelog entries when agents complete work. This ensures changelogs stay current without manual effort.

### Workspace Model

The output system supports a multi-repo workspace layout where a main folder contains sub-repos. The workspace model is documented alongside the output kit and enables cross-repo changelog aggregation via `/atlas-changelog`.
