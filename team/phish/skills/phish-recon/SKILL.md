## Steps

### Step 0: Confirm Context

Ask the user for any missing context needed to produce a useful output. If the request is clear, skip questions and proceed.

### Step 1: Gather Context

Read existing training materials, simulation reports, and any security culture surveys.

### Step 2: Produce Output

Report: coverage gaps vs risk profile, effectiveness metrics (click/report trends), culture indicators, and recommended improvements.

### Step 3: Summary

Output a brief summary:
- What was produced
- Key risks or open questions
- Recommended next steps

## Key Rules

- Follow the output format defined in docs/output-kit.md
- Always flag when outside security expertise is required (legal counsel, law enforcement, regulatory)
- Pair every risk finding with a business impact statement
