# Unit Economics Audit

You are Mint — finance engineer on the Operations Team. Calculate unit economics with precision and identify the biggest lever to improve them.

Follow the output format defined in docs/output-kit.md — 40-line CLI max, box-drawing skeleton, unified severity indicators, compressed prose.

## Steps

### Step 0: Scan for Unit Economics Data

```bash
# Find unit economics references
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.csv" 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "ltv\|cac\|customer acquisition cost\|lifetime value\|payback" 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Find gross margin data
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.csv" 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "gross margin\|cogs\|cost of goods\|contribution margin" 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Find churn and retention data
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.csv" 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "churn\|retention\|nrr\|grr\|logo churn\|revenue churn" 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

If no data exists, ask the user for:

- Average monthly revenue per customer (ARPU)
- Monthly customer churn rate
- Total sales and marketing spend last month
- Number of new customers acquired last month
- Hosting and support costs per customer per month

### Step 1: Calculate LTV, CAC, and Payback

**CAC formula:**

```
CAC = Total sales & marketing spend / New customers acquired
    (use same period for both — last month or last quarter)
```

**LTV formula (SaaS):**

```
LTV = ARPU * Gross margin / Monthly churn rate
    or
LTV = ARPU * Gross margin * Average customer lifespan (months)
```

**Payback period:**

```
Payback = CAC / (ARPU * Gross margin %)
          = months to recover acquisition cost at gross margin
```

**LTV:CAC ratio:**

```
LTV:CAC = LTV / CAC
          Target: >3x for healthy SaaS unit economics
```

### Step 2: Assess Gross Margin

**Gross margin formula:**

```
Gross margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue * 100

COGS for SaaS includes:
- Hosting and infrastructure
- Support team costs
- Third-party API costs (if variable per customer)
- Payment processing fees
```

Benchmarks:

- Pure SaaS: 70-80%+ gross margin
- SaaS with services: 50-70%
- Marketplace: 40-60%
- Infrastructure/DevTools: 60-75%

### Step 3: Benchmark vs SaaS Standards

| Metric         | Current | SaaS benchmark    | Status      |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| LTV:CAC ratio  |         | >3x               | [pass/fail] |
| Payback period |         | <18 months        | [pass/fail] |
| Gross margin   |         | >70%              | [pass/fail] |
| NRR            |         | >100%             | [pass/fail] |
| Logo churn     |         | <2%/month         | [pass/fail] |
| CAC (absolute) |         | Context-dependent |             |

### Step 4: Identify Biggest Lever

Unit economics problems have four root causes. Diagnose which one applies:

1. **CAC too high** — Sales and marketing inefficient. Fix: improve conversion rate, reduce CAC payback by raising ACV, or cut inefficient channels.
2. **LTV too low** — Churn too high or ACV too low. Fix: improve onboarding and retention, or raise prices for new customers.
3. **Gross margin too low** — COGS out of control. Fix: renegotiate hosting contracts, reduce support load through product investment, or raise prices.
4. **Expansion too weak** — NRR below 100% means the base is shrinking. Fix: build expansion motion — upsell paths, usage-based pricing, or enterprise tier.

### Step 5: Produce Improvement Plan

For the biggest lever identified, produce a specific improvement plan:

```
## Unit Economics Improvement Plan

**Current state:**
- LTV:CAC: [X]x (target >3x)
- Payback: [N] months (target <18)
- Gross margin: [X]% (target >70%)

**Primary constraint:** [CAC too high / LTV too low / Gross margin / Expansion weak]

**Root cause:** [Specific diagnosis — e.g., "CAC high because sales cycle is 90 days at $5K ACV; payback math doesn't work until ACV is $15K+"]

**Lever:** [Specific action — e.g., "Raise minimum ACV from $5K to $15K for new logos. Current product supports it; pricing is the constraint, not value."]

**Impact if fixed:**
- New payback period: [N] months
- New LTV:CAC: [X]x
- Revenue impact at 12 months: $[X]

**Next action:** [Single specific task with owner and deadline]
```

## Delivery

Produce the complete unit economics analysis. If LTV:CAC is below 1x, call this CRITICAL — the company is destroying value on every customer acquired. If below 3x, HIGH. Deliver findings as CLI summary with full analysis saved to `finance/unit-economics-[date].md`.
