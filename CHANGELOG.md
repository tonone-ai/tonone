# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-17

### Removed

- **Elephant memory bundled in tonone** — `hooks/elephant-recall.js`, `hooks/elephant-writer.js`, and the `skills/atlas-elephant/` skill are gone. Elephant is now a standalone plugin at [tonone-ai/elephant](https://github.com/tonone-ai/elephant); install it separately if you want persistent memory. This drops 4 hook entries from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (1× `SessionStart`, 3× `PostToolUse` on `Agent`/`Bash`/`Skill`).

### Changed

- **Onboarding tour** — `skills/tonone-onboard/` no longer advertises bundled elephant memory. Description, expert-path command list, mental-model section, and newcomer-path next-steps updated to reflect tonone's current scope (agents + skills + worktree sessions).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Lazy worktree creation** — sessions now start clean on `main` with no upfront worktree. The first `Edit`, `Write`, or `NotebookEdit` on main triggers a `PreToolUse` gate (`tonone-worktree-gate.js`) that blocks and asks Claude to create a properly-named branch. By the time the gate fires, Claude knows the task — so the slug is meaningful and no rename step is ever needed.

### Removed

- **Session-start auto-worktree** — `tonone-worktree-session.js` and its `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` branch naming removed. No more stale worktree branches accumulating per session.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **atlas-elephant skill** — renamed from `skills/elephant` to `skills/atlas-elephant` to satisfy 7 skill compliance checks: kebab-case naming, valid agent prefix (`atlas`), description trigger phrases, output-kit reference, atlas-report overflow clause, identity line, and structured workflow steps.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Eager worktree sessions** — `hooks/tonone-worktree-session.js` fires on `SessionStart` and auto-creates a worktree immediately, before any edits. Replaces the deferred gate approach. `plugin.json` wired; old `tonone-worktree-create.js` and `tonone-worktree-gate.js` deleted.
- **Human-readable branch names** — `.claude/branch-slug` maps session IDs to short slugs (e.g. `feat/auth-fixes`) so worktree branches are readable at a glance instead of UUID-based.
- **PR attribution** — `hooks/tonone-pr-attribution.js` appends a "Built by Tonone team" credits block to every PR body, listing the agents involved. Boosts K-factor via team credit visibility. Registered in `plugin.json`.
- **Elephant memory** — persistent caveman-compressed memory system: `hooks/tonone-elephant-writer.js` auto-captures agent completions, commits, and skill runs; `hooks/tonone-elephant-recall.js` surfaces a startup summary. `/elephant` skill adds `save`, `show`, and `compact` commands.
- **Elephant takeover** — `/elephant takeover` cold-starts the memory system from git history, bootstrapping recall for repos with no prior elephant data.
- **Statusline session goal** — Line 4 of the 3-line statusline redesign now shows the session goal. Shoutouts added.

### Fixed

- **Statusline** — `resets_at` now parsed as Unix seconds (not milliseconds), fixing incorrect pace projection display.
- **Worktree session hook** — removed unused `fs` import.

## [0.6.9] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Update checker** — `hooks/tonone-update-check.js` runs at `SessionStart`, fetches the latest version from GitHub at most once per 24 h, and notifies via OS notification + stderr line when a newer version is available. Result is cached in `~/.config/tonone/update-cache.json`.

## [0.6.8] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Notification system** — `hooks/tonone-notify.js` fires a macOS notification (via `osascript`) when Claude finishes a turn (`Stop` hook) or needs your attention (`Notification` hook). Sound plays via `afplay` and is on by default. Configure in `~/.config/tonone/config.json` under the `notify` key (`sound: bool`, `soundFile: string`).

## [0.6.7] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Agent eval suite** — 25 new tests across `test_agent_compliance.py` (11 tests) and `test_skill_compliance.py` (14 tests) validating frontmatter schema, model selection, communication protocol, identity lines, severity indicators, emoji, naming conventions, output-kit contract, atlas-report overflow clause, and structured workflow steps
- **Drift tracking** — known severity and emoji violations tracked in explicit sets with companion tests that fail when drift is fixed but not removed from the allowlist
- **CI gate** — agent and skill compliance tests wired into the validate-structure job

### Fixed

- **12 skills missing output-kit contract** — added the standard output-kit reference line to draft-landing, draft-patterns, form-exam, form-palette, form-style, lens-chart, pitch-landing, prism-chart, prism-stack, proof-design, surge-landing, touch-ui (root + team copies)

## [0.6.6] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Communication Protocol** — rolled out to all 21 agents (apex, atlas, cortex, crest, draft, forge, form, helm, lens, lumen, pave, pitch, prism, proof, relay, spine, surge, touch, vigil, volt, warden) and agent template; upgrades output-kit Language Rules to a full Communication Protocol
- **Agent template** — new agents now include communication protocol by default

### Fixed

- **plugin.json hooks** — inlined hooks directly in root plugin manifest to fix install validation failure

### Changed

- **Agent docs** — compressed prose across all 21 updated agent definitions
- **Agent plugin versions** — bumped from 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 for all agents with communication protocol changes

## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **README** — tagline sharpened to "One session. Two commands. Full team. Zero meetings."

### Fixed

- **test_structure.py** — updated naming assertion to match bare plugin name convention (no `tonone-` prefix) introduced in v0.6.4

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **bundle manifests** — removed invalid `"agents"` and `"skills"` string fields from all three bundle plugin.json files; Claude Code auto-discovers these directories and the string format caused a validation error on install
- **README** — Quick Start now shows both CLI (`claude plugin`) and in-session (`/plugin`) installation pathways; code fences labelled with language identifiers

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **plugin.json** — all four plugin manifests (root + 3 bundles) now declare `"agents"` and `"skills"` paths so agents like `/apex`, `/forge`, etc. are discoverable after installation

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **AGENTS.md** — Codex CLI compatibility layer: team roster, directory guide, and instructions for using agents and skills without the Claude Code plugin system
- **README** — Codex CLI quick start section (clone, `codex`, invoke agents by reading markdown directly)
- **docs/architecture.md** — platform support table documenting Claude Code (primary) vs Codex CLI (secondary)

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **README** — updated tagline from "Engineering second to none" to "Engineering + product, second to none"; added full Product team table (8 agents); expanded skill list from 77 to all 125; updated intro copy to reflect both teams
- **ROADMAP** — bumped version to v0.6.0, skills count to 125; replaced "Complete Product Team" section (already shipped) with stability and community goals for v1.0
- **docs/architecture.md** — corrected agent and skill counts from 15/77 to 23/125
- **docs/agent-guide.md, docs/skill-guide.md** — updated identity line examples from "Engineering Team" to "Tonone team"
- **docs/naming-guide.md** — removed "(Sprint 1–3)" label from Product Team section
- **templates/new-agent** — updated agent and skill templates to use "Tonone team" instead of "Engineering Team TEAM_LABEL team"
