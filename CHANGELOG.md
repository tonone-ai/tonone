# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Revenue team expanded** — Deal and Keep each gain 3 new skills: `deal-qualify` (MEDDPICC worksheet), `deal-proposal` (B2B proposal generator), `deal-outreach` (cold outbound sequence builder); `keep-qbr` (QBR template), `keep-churn` (churn risk and intervention), `keep-segment` (customer segmentation model). Revenue-team bundle gains Surge as third agent (6 skills: surge-activation, surge-experiment, surge-landing, surge-plg, surge-recon, surge-retention).
- **Marketing team expanded** — Ink and Buzz each gain 3 new skills: `ink-brief` (content brief generator), `ink-cluster` (topic cluster architecture), `ink-distribute` (distribution plan per piece); `buzz-devrel` (developer relations playbook), `buzz-outreach` (media/podcast pitch personalizer), `buzz-hn` (HN post crafter with anti-shadowban rules). Marketing-team bundle gains Pitch as third agent (6 skills: pitch-copy, pitch-landing, pitch-launch, pitch-message, pitch-position, pitch-recon).
- **Python analyzers** — all 4 revenue/marketing agents now have real analyzer modules: `deal_agent/pipeline_scanner.py` (CRM artifact detection, playbook coverage), `keep_agent/health_scorer.py` (onboarding coverage, churn signals), `ink_agent/topic_cluster.py` (content coverage, SEO signals), `buzz_agent/outreach_tracker.py` (press assets, community health). 134 tests, all passing.
- **Hooks** — `post_install` hooks wired to all 4 agents (deal, keep, ink, buzz), matching engineering-team pattern.
- **Bundle manifests** — revenue-team and marketing-team bundles gain `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, making them installable as standalone plugins.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Apex depth layer** — `health_aggregator.py` runs Warden, Forge, Cortex, and Spine scans in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor` and merges findings into a unified `AgentReport`. `dependency_graph.py` AST-walks all Python scripts in `team/*/scripts/`, detects circular imports (DFS), and flags unused internal modules. Entry point: `apex_scan.py` writes `.reports/apex-<ts>.json` and exits 2 on CRITICAL/HIGH findings.
- **Spine depth layer** — `n_plus_one_detector.py` statically detects ORM query patterns inside loops, raw SQL in loops, and string-formatted SQL across Python files. `endpoint_profiler.py` times HTTP endpoints with configurable warmup runs and reports p50/p95/p99 latency, flagging endpoints above 200 ms (MEDIUM), 500 ms (HIGH), or 1 s (CRITICAL). Entry point: `perf_scan.py`.
- **Cortex depth layer** — `llm_usage_scanner.py` detects missing error handling on LLM calls, unbounded cost patterns, hardcoded model names, and synchronous calls inside async functions. `prompt_evaluator.py` scores prompt files for injection risk, output format contracts, and token efficiency. Entry point: `eval_scan.py`.
- **Forge depth layer** — `infracost_analyzer.py` wraps the Infracost CLI to produce per-resource cost diffs. `cloud_cost_fetcher.py` queries AWS Cost Explorer (14-day window, grouped by service) and flags services with >$50 monthly spend or >20% week-over-week growth. Entry point: `cost_scan.py`.
- **`/contribute` skill** — community contribution workflow for Pave: forks the repo, scaffolds a branch, runs compliance checks, and guides contributors through the PR process.
- **`/form-brief`** — new Form skill that extracts a structured design brief (audience, goal, constraints, inspiration) before any visual work begins. Reduces brief-less design rewrites.
- **`/form-critique` and `/draft-wireframe` upgrades** — both skills absorb design principles from the open-design project (information architecture, motion poetry, minimalism schools), adding competitive audit steps and shipability gates.

### Fixed

- **CI test matrix** — agent test jobs were wired to non-existent venv paths; matrix now activates each agent's virtual environment correctly before running pytest. The `no-op` test placeholder was replaced with a real smoke test.
- **Trunk python runtime** — `python@3.14.4` in `.trunk/trunk.yaml` referenced a non-existent version (Python 3.14 is still pre-release). Downgraded to `3.13.3` to prevent trunk from failing to provision the Python runtime for bandit, ruff, isort, and black.

### Changed

- **CI version gate** — new `check-versions` job runs `scripts/bump-version.py --check` on every PR. Version drift across 194 manifest files can no longer merge undetected.

## [0.9.9] — 2026-05-05 (patch 2)

### Changed

- **Version enforcement:** `scripts/bump-version.py` gains `--check` mode (exits 1 if any manifest deviates from root). New CI job `check-versions` runs this on every PR so version drift can never merge again.
- **Version sync:** All 194 plugin.json and pyproject.toml files synced to 0.9.9. Prior drift: most agents at 0.9.7, warden at 0.9.8, new agents (buzz/deal/ink/keep) at 0.1.0.
- **Shared library relocated:** `team/shared/` moved to `lib/shared/` — it was a Python library, not an agent. Fixes phantom "shared" agent detection in CI structure tests.
- **New agent scaffolding:** buzz, deal, ink, keep gain `scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/pyproject.toml` (required for CI structure gate).
- **Skill renamed:** `skills/contribute` → `skills/pave-contribute`. Fixes agent-prefix naming rule; now routes to Pave correctly.
- **forge-cost synced:** Root `skills/forge-cost/SKILL.md` was 2 versions behind team canonical — updated to include real infracost + AWS Cost Explorer scanner steps.
- **Output-kit compliance:** Added required output-kit and atlas-report contract lines to 10 skills: buzz-community, buzz-launch, buzz-pitch, buzz-social, form-brief, ink-calendar, ink-case, ink-post, ink-seo, warden-scan, and all deal/keep skills.
- **warden-scan:** Root `skills/warden-scan/` copy created (existed in team/ only).
- **README badge:** Updated version badge from 0.9.7 to 0.9.9.

All 54 CI structure and compliance tests now pass.

## [0.9.9] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Deal** — Revenue & Sales agent: MEDDPICC deal qualification, 3-stage sales model ($0→$1M→$10M→$100M), pipeline design, playbook authoring, pricing strategy, and enterprise closing. Includes extreme growth playbook from Stripe (Collison Installation), Retool (funded-company outbound), Rippling (human cold-calling). 5 skills: `/deal-recon`, `/deal-pipeline`, `/deal-playbook`, `/deal-pricing`, `/deal-close`.
- **Keep** — Customer Success agent: NRR engine model, health scoring, onboarding flow design, expansion playbooks, churn prevention. Includes growth tactics from Superhuman (concierge onboarding), Notion (template retention moat), PostHog (product-usage health signals). 5 skills: `/keep-recon`, `/keep-health`, `/keep-onboard`, `/keep-expand`, `/keep-playbook`.
- **Ink** — Content Marketing agent: topic cluster architecture, stage-aware SEO, blog drafting, content calendar, case studies. Includes playbook from Stripe (docs-as-marketing), PostHog (open handbook SEO), Linear (changelog-as-marketing). 5 skills: `/ink-recon`, `/ink-post`, `/ink-seo`, `/ink-calendar`, `/ink-case`.
- **Buzz** — PR & Community agent: PESO media model, community flywheel design, press pitch writing, social drafting, DevRel, launch coordination. Includes playbook from Figma (network graph mapping), Webflow (community-in-existing-communities), PostHog (HN honest founder story). 5 skills: `/buzz-recon`, `/buzz-pitch`, `/buzz-social`, `/buzz-community`, `/buzz-launch`.
- All 4 agents embed **0-to-$100M stage-aware framing** (Stage 1: $0-$1M / Stage 2: $1M-$10M / Stage 3: $10M-$100M). Each agent diagnoses the current stage before producing output.
- Product team grows from 8 to 12 agents. Total: **27 agents, 186 skills**.

## [0.9.8] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **warden-scan:** New `/warden-scan` skill — runs Semgrep SAST and pip-audit dependency scanning against any target path and writes a structured JSON report to `.reports/`.
- **shared report schema:** `team/shared/report_schema.py` introduces `Finding`, `AgentReport`, `Summary`, and `ReportMetadata` dataclasses as the unified output contract for all depth agents.
- **Semgrep integration:** `semgrep_scanner.py` wraps the Semgrep CLI with structured JSON output and handles first-run initialization timeouts and missing installs gracefully.
- **pip-audit integration:** `pip_auditor.py` scans `requirements*.txt` files (or falls back to the active environment) for known CVEs.
- **22 tests:** Full coverage for report schema, scanner, auditor, and CLI entry point including all error paths.
- **`.semgrepignore`:** Empty root-level file replaces semgrep's built-in default ignore patterns so all project files are eligible for scanning.
- **`.reports/` gitignored:** Scan report output directory excluded from version control.

## [0.9.7] — 2026-04-28

### Improved

- **relay-ship:** PR footer is now a rich attributed block — shows Tonone branding, agents used, session duration, and estimated cost. Previously collapsed to a bare link.

## [0.9.6] — 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Elephant memory seeded from full git history via `/elephant takeover` — all 91+ commits now indexed for cross-session recall.
- README version badge corrected from `0.9.1` to `0.9.5`.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-04-28

### Changed

- **`relay-ship` PR footer** — replaced bare `🤖 Relay — tonone Engineering Team` with a friendly multi-line attribution that names the agents involved, session duration, and approximate token cost. Relay fills in the placeholders at PR-creation time from session context.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **`tonone-session-tracker.js` and `tonone-pr-attribution.js` never ran** — both hooks existed but were not declared in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Every Skill invocation went untracked and every PR shipped without agent attribution since the hooks were added.
- **`tonone-worktree-session.js` missing** — tests expected this SessionStart hook since commit `24498a2` but it was never created. The hook now prunes stale git worktrees at session start and emits `WORKTREE_READY` status so Claude knows whether it is resuming an existing worktree or starting fresh on main.
- **`tonone-worktree-session.js` not registered** — hook was implemented but absent from the `SessionStart` array in `plugin.json`, making the prune and status features dead code.
- **`tonone-git-gate.js` passed wrong argument to `EnterWorktree`** — the blocked-on-main recovery message passed `${branchName}` (slug only) but `EnterWorktree` requires the full worktree path. Now passes `${worktreePath}`.
- **`tonone-git-gate.js` TOCTOU** — two separate `execSync` calls for `--git-dir` and `--git-common-dir` could race if git state changed between calls. Merged into a single atomic invocation.
- **`tonone-git-gate.js` + `tonone-worktree-session.js` array bounds** — `git rev-parse --git-dir --git-common-dir` output was split by newline without a length check. If git returned fewer than 2 lines, `parts[1]` was `undefined`, incorrectly treating main as a worktree.
- **`tonone-pr-attribution.js` URL extraction silent failure** — `toolOutput.output || toolOutput` fell through to the object itself when `.output` was falsy, causing `String(object)` to produce `[object Object]` and silently failing to extract the GitHub PR URL on every PR.
- **`bump-version.py` corrupted active worktrees** — `Path.glob("**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json")` recursed into `.claude/worktrees/`, writing version changes into every active worktree and dirtying them. Now excludes `.claude/worktrees/` alongside templates and venvs.

### Tests

- 3 regression tests for `getPrUrl()` — covers object `.output` field, plain string, and no-URL fallback.
- Worktree exclusion test for `bump-version.py` `find_files()`.
- Source assertion that `EnterWorktree` receives `${worktreePath}` not `${branchName}`.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **`/draft-proto`** — hi-fi interactive HTML prototype skill for Draft. Takes wireframes to the next level: single-file React+Babel HTML, device-framed (iOS), real images from Wikimedia/Unsplash, state-driven navigation, Playwright-verified before delivery. Fills the gap between `/draft-wireframe` (lo-fi) and `/prism-ui` (production code).
- **`/form-direction`** — design direction advisor for Form. Generates 3 differentiated visual directions from 5 design schools (Information Architecture, Motion Poetry, Minimalism, Experimental Avant-garde, Eastern Philosophy), each with a parallel HTML demo. Richer than `/form-style`: produces actual visual demos for selection, not just text recommendations.
- **`/form-animate`** — motion design skill for Form. HTML animation to Playwright render to MP4/GIF export with BGM. Includes brand asset protocol, anti-AI-slop guardrails (no CSS silhouettes, no blue-purple gradient defaults), and narrative structure (hook, build, resolve, hold).
- **`/form-critique`** — 5-dimension expert design critique for Form. Scores coherence, visual hierarchy, execution craft, functionality, and innovation 0-10 with ASCII radar chart and Keep/Fix/Quick Wins punch list. Distinct from `/form-audit` (technical QA): evaluates design as a craft object.
- **`form-palette` and `form-style`** registered in Form plugin.json (previously existed but untracked).

### Changed

- Draft agent definition updated with `## Draft Skills` routing table referencing `/draft-wireframe` vs `/draft-proto` decision logic.
- Form agent definition updated with `## Form Skills` routing table for all 6 specialized workflows.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **23 agent entry-point skills** — each agent now has a root `/apex`, `/helm`, `/forge`, etc. skill that accepts any task description and routes internally to the right sub-skill. Users no longer need to know which sub-skill to call; they hand the task to the agent and the agent decides. Brings total skill count to 161.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- Fix `tonone-onboard` skill compliance — quoted YAML description (colon broke parse), added Step 2/3 workflow headers, exempted from prefix/output-kit/atlas-report checks via new `SPECIAL_SKILLS` set

### Changed

- README reframed around founder vision — "Founder + Tonone = whole company" thesis, roadmap table with sales/CS/finance/ops phases, skill count corrected to 138
- Add `launch/` folder — HN post and X thread drafts for public launch prep

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-17

### Removed

- **Elephant memory bundled in tonone** — `hooks/elephant-recall.js`, `hooks/elephant-writer.js`, and the `skills/atlas-elephant/` skill are gone. Elephant is now a standalone plugin at [tonone-ai/elephant](https://github.com/tonone-ai/elephant); install it separately if you want persistent memory. This drops 4 hook entries from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (1× `SessionStart`, 3× `PostToolUse` on `Agent`/`Bash`/`Skill`).

### Changed

- **Onboarding tour** — `skills/tonone-onboard/` no longer advertises bundled elephant memory. Description, expert-path command list, mental-model section, and newcomer-path next-steps updated to reflect tonone's current scope (agents + skills + worktree sessions).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Lazy worktree creation** — sessions now start clean on `main` with no upfront worktree. The first `Edit`, `Write`, or `NotebookEdit` on main triggers a `PreToolUse` gate (`tonone-worktree-gate.js`) that blocks and asks Claude to create a properly-named branch. By the time the gate fires, Claude knows the task — so the slug is meaningful and no rename step is ever needed.

### Removed

- **Session-start auto-worktree** — `tonone-worktree-session.js` and its `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` branch naming removed. No more stale worktree branches accumulating per session.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **atlas-elephant skill** — renamed from `skills/elephant` to `skills/atlas-elephant` to satisfy 7 skill compliance checks: kebab-case naming, valid agent prefix (`atlas`), description trigger phrases, output-kit reference, atlas-report overflow clause, identity line, and structured workflow steps.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Eager worktree sessions** — `hooks/tonone-worktree-session.js` fires on `SessionStart` and auto-creates a worktree immediately, before any edits. Replaces the deferred gate approach. `plugin.json` wired; old `tonone-worktree-create.js` and `tonone-worktree-gate.js` deleted.
- **Human-readable branch names** — `.claude/branch-slug` maps session IDs to short slugs (e.g. `feat/auth-fixes`) so worktree branches are readable at a glance instead of UUID-based.
- **PR attribution** — `hooks/tonone-pr-attribution.js` appends a "Built by Tonone team" credits block to every PR body, listing the agents involved. Boosts K-factor via team credit visibility. Registered in `plugin.json`.
- **Elephant memory** — persistent caveman-compressed memory system: `hooks/tonone-elephant-writer.js` auto-captures agent completions, commits, and skill runs; `hooks/tonone-elephant-recall.js` surfaces a startup summary. `/elephant` skill adds `save`, `show`, and `compact` commands.
- **Elephant takeover** — `/elephant takeover` cold-starts the memory system from git history, bootstrapping recall for repos with no prior elephant data.
- **Statusline session goal** — Line 4 of the 3-line statusline redesign now shows the session goal. Shoutouts added.

### Fixed

- **Statusline** — `resets_at` now parsed as Unix seconds (not milliseconds), fixing incorrect pace projection display.
- **Worktree session hook** — removed unused `fs` import.

## [0.6.9] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Update checker** — `hooks/tonone-update-check.js` runs at `SessionStart`, fetches the latest version from GitHub at most once per 24 h, and notifies via OS notification + stderr line when a newer version is available. Result is cached in `~/.config/tonone/update-cache.json`.

## [0.6.8] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Notification system** — `hooks/tonone-notify.js` fires a macOS notification (via `osascript`) when Claude finishes a turn (`Stop` hook) or needs your attention (`Notification` hook). Sound plays via `afplay` and is on by default. Configure in `~/.config/tonone/config.json` under the `notify` key (`sound: bool`, `soundFile: string`).

## [0.6.7] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Agent eval suite** — 25 new tests across `test_agent_compliance.py` (11 tests) and `test_skill_compliance.py` (14 tests) validating frontmatter schema, model selection, communication protocol, identity lines, severity indicators, emoji, naming conventions, output-kit contract, atlas-report overflow clause, and structured workflow steps
- **Drift tracking** — known severity and emoji violations tracked in explicit sets with companion tests that fail when drift is fixed but not removed from the allowlist
- **CI gate** — agent and skill compliance tests wired into the validate-structure job

### Fixed

- **12 skills missing output-kit contract** — added the standard output-kit reference line to draft-landing, draft-patterns, form-exam, form-palette, form-style, lens-chart, pitch-landing, prism-chart, prism-stack, proof-design, surge-landing, touch-ui (root + team copies)

## [0.6.6] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Communication Protocol** — rolled out to all 21 agents (apex, atlas, cortex, crest, draft, forge, form, helm, lens, lumen, pave, pitch, prism, proof, relay, spine, surge, touch, vigil, volt, warden) and agent template; upgrades output-kit Language Rules to a full Communication Protocol
- **Agent template** — new agents now include communication protocol by default

### Fixed

- **plugin.json hooks** — inlined hooks directly in root plugin manifest to fix install validation failure

### Changed

- **Agent docs** — compressed prose across all 21 updated agent definitions
- **Agent plugin versions** — bumped from 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 for all agents with communication protocol changes

## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **README** — tagline sharpened to "One session. Two commands. Full team. Zero meetings."

### Fixed

- **test_structure.py** — updated naming assertion to match bare plugin name convention (no `tonone-` prefix) introduced in v0.6.4

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **bundle manifests** — removed invalid `"agents"` and `"skills"` string fields from all three bundle plugin.json files; Claude Code auto-discovers these directories and the string format caused a validation error on install
- **README** — Quick Start now shows both CLI (`claude plugin`) and in-session (`/plugin`) installation pathways; code fences labelled with language identifiers

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **plugin.json** — all four plugin manifests (root + 3 bundles) now declare `"agents"` and `"skills"` paths so agents like `/apex`, `/forge`, etc. are discoverable after installation

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **AGENTS.md** — Codex CLI compatibility layer: team roster, directory guide, and instructions for using agents and skills without the Claude Code plugin system
- **README** — Codex CLI quick start section (clone, `codex`, invoke agents by reading markdown directly)
- **docs/architecture.md** — platform support table documenting Claude Code (primary) vs Codex CLI (secondary)

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **README** — updated tagline from "Engineering second to none" to "Engineering + product, second to none"; added full Product team table (8 agents); expanded skill list from 77 to all 125; updated intro copy to reflect both teams
- **ROADMAP** — bumped version to v0.6.0, skills count to 125; replaced "Complete Product Team" section (already shipped) with stability and community goals for v1.0
- **docs/architecture.md** — corrected agent and skill counts from 15/77 to 23/125
- **docs/agent-guide.md, docs/skill-guide.md** — updated identity line examples from "Engineering Team" to "Tonone team"
- **docs/naming-guide.md** — removed "(Sprint 1–3)" label from Product Team section
- **templates/new-agent** — updated agent and skill templates to use "Tonone team" instead of "Engineering Team TEAM_LABEL team"

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

- Form agent plugin manifest updated to register all 10 skills
- Relay agent plugin manifest updated with relay-ship skill

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-03

- **`atlas-report`** — opens browser immediately without prompting for confirmation
- **`apex-takeover`** — Phase 3 CLI output reduced to a 6-line receipt; all findings route to HTML report
- **`apex-plan`** — report path updated to `.agent-logs/reports/`; CLI receipt format tightened
- **`apex-review`** — CLI verdict only (READY TO SHIP / DO NOT SHIP + risk counts); full findings in HTML
- **`output-kit`** — added Browser-First Reporting section as canonical team rule; report storage path standardized to `.agent-logs/reports/`

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-29
